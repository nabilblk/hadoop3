//Machine Learning
1) Data Cleansing (error in sourcing, storing, retrieving, transformation, pipelining etc)
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (Bell Labs)vs. Confirmation Data Analysis 
   5 number summary - sample minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, sample maximum - box plot, stem and leaf diagram
   Summary Sets - Anscombe's Quartet 1973
3) Supervisory Learning (kNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression?, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests)
   Unsupervisory Techniques (Clustering, Factor Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
4) Normal Distrib, Central Limit Theorem (Th distribution of sum of n identically distributed random variables X approaches a normal distrib as n-> infinity)
        t-test & ANOVA 
    mean, variance, t-test, ANOVA -? assumes data are normally distributed
5)  Other distribs  - Poisson D, Exponential D, Chi-Sq D, Zipf, Yule, Pareto, Binomaial, Multinomial

ML-Lib 
======
1) Classification - SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K-NN
2) Regression - Linear, Lasso, Ridge, K-Neigherest Neighbor
3) Misc - Alternating Least Squares, K-Means, SVD, Opt Primitives(SGD, L-BGFS)
4) Colloborative Filtering
5) Text Analysis
6) Entity Resolution (ER)

Terminology:
======
Observations: Items (or entities) used for learning or for observation. eg. emails
Features: Attributes (typically numeric) used to represent observations (eg. for emails:  length, date, keywords etc)
Labels: Values/Categories defined for Observations (eg. face=1 or 0 for image recognition or spam=0 or 1 for spam detection)
Training Data set: Dataset used for training the algorithm
Test Data Set: The data set used for validation purposes (Test data is typically withheld at the time of training)

Supervised Learning:
=======
Labels teach the machine

eg. Classification (spam detection)- categories are discrete (no closeness of labels )
Regression (eg. stock price prediction)- categories are continuous (closeness possible)
Unsupervisory Learning:
====
"Algorithm" should detect latent structure from the features alone
Often used as a pre-processing step for Supervisory learning (or) for exploratory purposes

Clustering - communities with a large group
Dimensionalatiy Reduction - pixels-> High Density images

Steps Involved in Unsupervised Learning:
=====
Obtain Raw Data-> Feature Extraction->Supervised Learning->Evaluation (Iterate and improve features if necessary) -> Prediction
